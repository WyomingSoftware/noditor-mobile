
## Noditor Mobile App
The Noditor Mobile App is a Node.js developer tool.

The Noditor Mobile App connects to any Node.js Server App. The Node.js Server App must have the Noditor Module installed (npm install noditor --save).

The Noditor Module gathers and maintains a small amount of runtime statistics that can be accessed via a single REST endpoint.

Once the Node.js Server App is up and running the Noditor Mobile App can gather stats from the Noditor Module and display graphs as well as other high-level data.

The Noditor Mobile App and Noditor Module are free.
