
## Noditor Mobile App
The Noditor Mobile App connects to your Node.js Server App. Your Node.js Server App
must have the Noditor Module installed (npm install noditor --save).

The Noditor Module gathers and maintains a small amount of runtime statistics that can be accessed via a single REST endpoint.

Once your Node.js Server App is running the Noditor Mobile App can gather stats from the Noditor Module and display graphs and other high level data. (a.k.a. Pocket NOC)

The app is available for free for both iOS and Android. The Noditor Module is also free. Its all free.
