
## Noditor Mobile App
The Noditor Mobile App is part of the Noditor Monitor System for Node.js. The Noditor Mobile App connects to any Node.js App running the Noditor Module (npm install noditor --save). Learn more about the Noditor Monitoring System on **[GitHub](https://github.com/WyomingSoftware/noditor)** or  **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/noditor)**.

The Noditor Module gathers and maintains a small amount of runtime statistics that can be accessed via a single REST endpoint. Once a Node.js App is up and running the Noditor Mobile App can gather stats from the Noditor Module and display graphs as well as other high-level data.

The Noditor Mobile App and Noditor Module are free.
